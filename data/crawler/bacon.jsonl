Open - wheel cars licensed use public roads ( street legal ) , Ariel Atom , uncommon , impractical everyday use . [ 1 ] History [ edit ] American racecar driver constructor Ray Harroun early pioneer concept lightweight single - seater , open - wheel \" monoposto \" racecar . [ 2 ] working mechanic automotive industry , Harroun began competitive professional racing 1906 , winning AAA National Championship 1910 . hired Marmon Motor Car Company chief engineer , charged building racecar intended race Indianapolis 500 , went win . developed revolutionary concept originator forefather single - seater ( i.e. monoposto ) racecar design . [ 3 ] [ 4 ] Harroun credited pioneering rear - view mirror appeared 1911 Indianapolis 500 winning car , claimed got idea seeing mirror similar purpose horse - drawn vehicle 1904 . [ 5 ] Ford Model T , popular road - legal cars early 20th century . Note wheels outside main body car , typical era . Prior World War II , street automobiles generally wheels protruded vehicle main body , typically covered mudguards protect car body following traffic water mud spray . advent unibody vehicle construction , desire maximise interior space , improve aerodynamics , aircraft - inspired styling trends era , end 1950s majority new road - registerable vehicles wheels main body car , open - wheel design exclusively associated racing vehicles . 1954 Mercedes - Benz 300 SL featured wheels main body vehicle , primarily aerodynamic drag reduction Formula cars exclusively open - wheel design history championship . notable exception \" Monza body \" variation Mercedes - Benz W196 racer 1954\u201355 , covered wheels bodywork aerodynamic reasons .   Modern Formula regulations mandate open - wheel configuration . Design [ edit ] typical open - wheeler minimal cockpit , sufficient enclose driver body , head exposed air . Whelen Modified Tour short track modified series , driver head contained car . modern cars , engine located directly driver drives rear wheels ; asphalt modified cars , Whelen Modified Tour , engine driver . Depending rules class , types open - wheelers wings rear vehicle , low virtually flat undertray helps achieve additional aerodynamic downforce pushing car road . categories racing cars produce downforce , categories open - wheel racing cars ( particularly Formula IndyCar ) produce far downforce relative mass racing category , allowing higher corner speeds comparable tracks . major races , Singapore Grand Prix , Monaco Grand Prix ( sanctioned Formula ) Long Beach Grand Prix ( sanctioned IndyCar ) , held temporary street circuits . , open - wheel races dedicated road courses , Watkins Glen , N\u00fcrburgring Germany , Spa - Francorchamps Belgium Silverstone Great Britain . United States , - level open - wheel events held ovals , short track superspeedway variety , emphasis   speed endurance maneuverability required road street course events . Whelen Modified Tour opened wheeled race car series endorsed NASCAR . series races NASCAR famous tracks United States . asphalt modified series race short tracks United States Canada , Wyoming County International Speedway New York . best - attended oval race world annual Indianapolis 500 ( Indy 500 ) Speedway , Indiana , sanctioned IndyCar ; United States common refer open - wheel cars IndyCars , recognizable appearance widespread popularity America Indy 500 . \n Compared covered - wheel race cars , open - wheeled cars allow precise placement wheels race course , tires clearly visible driver . allows maximum potential cars achieved cornering passing . Furthermore , open - wheeled cars tolerant vehicle - - vehicle contact , usually results vehicle damage retiring , level contact expected covered - wheel racing , example NASCAR . Open - wheeled drivers extremely precise avoid contact . Regulations tend permit lower open - wheel car weights categories closely resemble street - legal vehicles , sports , touring , stock cars .   instance , Formula car weigh 798 kilograms ( 1,759 \u00a0 lb ) ; [ 6 ] minimum weight NASCAR 1,500 kilograms ( 3,200 \u00a0 lb ) . [ 7 ] Driving [ edit ] Open - wheeled racing fastest world . Formula cars reach speeds excess 360 kilometres hour ( 220 \u00a0 mph ) . Autodromo Nazionale Monza , Ant\u00f4nio Pizzonia BMW Williams F1 team recorded speed 369.9 kilometres hour ( 229.8 \u00a0 mph ) ( 102 m / s ) 2004 Italian Grand Prix . end V10 era 2006 , high speeds   reached , later vehicles reaching 360 kilometres hour ( 220 \u00a0 mph ) .

Concept [ edit ] 2007 design finalist cars ; left , University Michigan - Ann Arbor , TU Graz , University Wisconsin - Madison , Kansas . Absent Pennsylvania State University concept Formula SAE fictional manufacturing company contracted student design team develop small Formula - style race car . prototype race car evaluated potential production item . target marketing group race car non - professional weekend autocross racer . student team designs , builds tests prototype based series rules , purpose ensuring - track safety ( cars driven students ) promoting clever problem solving . combustion electric divisions competition , primarily differing rules powertrain . prototype race car judged number different events . points schedule Formula SAE events : [ 1 ] Static Events Design Event 150 Cost & Manufacturing Analysis Event 100 Presentation Event 75 Dynamic Events Acceleration Event 100 Skidpad Event 75 Autocross Event 125 Fuel Economy Event 100 Endurance Event 275 Total Points Possible 1,000 addition events , sponsors competition provide awards superior design accomplishments . example , best use E-85 ethanol fuel , innovative use electronics , recyclability , crash worthiness , analytical approach design , overall dynamic performance awards available . beginning competition , vehicle checked rule compliance Technical Inspection . braking ability , rollover stability noise levels checked vehicle allowed compete dynamic events ( Skidpad , Autocross , Acceleration , Endurance ) . Large companies , General Motors , Ford , Chrysler , staff interact 1000 student engineers . Working teams 30 , students proven capable producing functioning prototype vehicle . [ 2 ] volunteers design judging include racing industry prominent engineers consultants including late Carroll Smith , Bill Mitchell , Doug Milliken , Claude Rouelle , Jack Auld , John LePlante , Ron Tauranac , Bryan Kubala . Today , competition expanded includes 12 events world . example , Formula Student similar SAE - sanctioned event UK , Formula SAE Australasia ( Formula SAE - ) taking place Australia . Verein Deutscher Ingenieure ( VDI ) holds Formula Student Germany competition Hockenheimring . 2007 , offshoot called Formula Hybrid inaugurated . similar Formula SAE , cars gasoline - electric hybrid power plants . competition takes place New Hampshire International Speedway . [ 1 ] 2010 , Formula Student Electric inaugurated , requires students build fully electrically powered racing vehicle . 2017 , Formula Student Driverless inaugurated . Summary rules [ edit ] Student competition [ edit ] Formula SAE relatively performance restrictions . team entirely active college students ( including drivers ) places obvious restrictions available work hours , skill sets , experience , presents unique challenges professional race teams face paid , skilled staff . restriction means rest regulations restrictive professional series . Students allowed receive advice criticism professional engineers faculty , car design students . Students solely responsible fundraising , successful teams based curricular programs university - sponsored budgets . Additionally , points system organized multiple strategies lead success . leads great variety cars , rarity world motorsports . Engine ( IC Competition ) [ edit ] engine - stroke , Otto - cycle piston engine displacement greater 710cc . air restrictor circular cross - section fitted downstream throttle upstream compressor , diameter greater 20 mm gasoline engines , forced induction naturally aspirated , 19 mm ethanol - fueled engines . restrictor keeps power levels 100 \u00a0 hp vast majority FSAE cars . commonly , production - cylinder 600cc sport bike engines availability displacement .   , teams use smaller V - twin single - cylinder engines , mainly weight - saving packaging benefits . rarely teams build engine scratch , examples include Western Washington University 554cc V8 entry 2001 , University Melbourne \" WATTARD \" engine 2003\u20132004 , University Auckland V twin . Electric Powertrain ( EV Competition ) [ edit ] accumulator voltage greater 600V , capacity limit . energy meter installed competition ensuring 80kW drawn . teams elect use lithium - ion cells , lead acid cells energy storage devices capacitors permitted \u2014 accounts commonly referred battery pack referred accumulator competition . Cell voltages temperatures monitored individual cell connected fusible links . challenges lead ( especially young ) teams use preconfigured cell modules connected accumulator enclosure . competition organizers attempt prepare teams competition EV technical inspection having teams complete Electrical Safety Form ( ESF ) prior competition \u2014 form outlines parts high voltage system design decisions team making . Suspension [ edit ] suspension unrestricted save safety regulations requirement 50 mm total wheel travel . teams opt - wheel independent suspension , universally double - wishbone . Active suspension legal . Aerodynamics [ edit ] Complex aerodynamic packages , required compete competition common fastest teams competition . low speeds FSAE competition rarely exceeding 60 \u00a0 mph ( 97 \u00a0 km / h ) , designs thoroughly justified design judging event wind tunnel testing , computational fluid dynamics , track testing . Aerodynamic devices regulated maximum size powered aerodynamic devices outlawed . Weight [ edit ] weight restriction . weight average competitive Formula SAE car usually 440 \u00a0 lb ( 200 \u00a0 kg ) race trim . , lack weight regulation combined somewhat fixed power ceiling encourages teams adopt innovative weight - saving strategies , use composite materials , elaborate expensive machining projects , rapid prototyping . 2009 fuel economy portion endurance event assigned 100 400 endurance points , 50 . rules change marked trend engine downsizing attempt save weight increase fuel economy . - running teams switched high - powered - cylinder cars smaller , one- - cylinder engines , usually power , allow weight savings 75 \u00a0 lb ( 34 \u00a0 kg ) , provide better fuel economy . lightweight single - cylinder car reasonable pace endurance race , points lost overall time heavier , high - powered cars exceptional fuel economy score . Example : 2009 Formula SAE West endurance event , - place finishers Rochester Institute Technology completed endurance course 22 minutes , 45 seconds - cylinder car , fourth - place finishers Oregon State University finished 22 minutes , 47 seconds single - cylinder car ; gave RIT 290.6 300 points race portion event OSU 289.2 points . , OSU fuel car ( .671 \u00a0 \u00a0 gal ( 2.54 \u00a0 L ) , 20.3 \u00a0 mpg \u2011US ( 0.116 \u00a0 L / km ) entire endurance race ) received 100 points fuel economy , RIT 1.163 \u00a0 \u00a0 gal ( 4.40 \u00a0 L ) ( 11.75 \u00a0 mpg \u2011US ( 0.2002 \u00a0 L / km ) ) awarded 23.9 available points . RIT went win overall competition 8.9 points OSU , having scored slightly better dynamic events . [ 3 ] Safety [ edit ] majority regulations pertain safety . Cars steel roll hoops designated thickness alloy , regardless composition rest chassis . impact attenuator nose , impact testing data attenuator submitted prior competing . Cars hydraulic brake circuits , - point racing harnesses , meet geometric templates driver location cockpit drivers competing . Tilt - tests ensure fluids spill car heavy cornering , line - - sight driver fuel , coolant , oil lines . Electric vehicles fitted Shutdown Circuit , physical electrical path current takes closes main contactors vehicle . safety buttons , switches , circuits Shutdown Circuit removing physically impossible high voltage present outside accumulator . History [ edit ] University Texas Arlington Formula SAE car , 1986 1979 SAE Mini - Indy held University Houston .   Conceived Dr. Kurt M. Marshek , competition inspired - article appeared Popular Mechanics magazine , small , \" Indy - style \" vehicle wood , powered - horsepower Briggs Stratton engine .   Mini Baja competitions guide , engineering students design build small , \" Indy - style \" vehicles stock engine Popular Mechanics article . Thirteen schools entered competed . University Texas El Paso won overall competition chief supervision . Dr. William Shapton ( recently left University Cincinnati join Michigan Technological University ) broached idea hosting similar competition 1980 , stepped organize Mini - Indy . 1980 members new SAE student branch University Texas ( Austin ) learned Mini - Indy died , generated concept new intercollegiate student engineering design competition allow students apply learning classroom complex , real - world engineering design problem : design development race car .   UT SAE student branch members Robert Edwards John Tellkamp led discussion UT SAE members envisioned competition involve designing constructing race car lines SCCA Formula 440 entry - level racing series popular time .   Prof. Matthews came \u201c Formula SAE \u201d following format Formula Formula Vee emphasizing new race car engineering competition driver competition .   Schools meet end academic year compete determine built best car .   Edwards , Tellkamp , fellow UT SAE students Joe Green , Dick Morton , Mike Best , Carl Morris drafted set safety competition rules presented SAE student branch membership UT SAE Faculty Advisor Prof. Ron Matthews .   Prof. Matthews contacted Bob Sechler SAE Educational Relations Department SAE headquarters asked permission establish new intercollegiate student engineering design competition host Formula SAE competition summer 1981 , agreed .   newly formed UT SAE branch , consisting automotive motorcycle enthusiasts pursuing engineering degrees , including left careers fields job market virtually disappeared depressed economy early 1980s \u2013 including experienced auto mechanics , embraced adopted concept little idea getting .   SAE student branch officers Mike Best , Carl Morris , Sylvia Obregon , Dr. Matthews began planning organizing event held following year . , important note Formula SAE simple renaming Mini - Indy competition instead entirely new intercollegiate student engineering design competition .   Unlike previous SAE - sanctioned student racing / design competitions including Mini - Indy , Formula SAE rules left selection engine design team , long 4 stroke engine - inch diameter intake restrictor .   ( current Formula SAE rules allow teams use 4 - stroke engines 710 cc , smaller restrictor . )   , unlike previous SAE - sanctioned student racing / design competitions including Mini - Indy , engine modifications allowed encouraged . \n Formula SAE competition held parking lot UT baseball field ( Disch - Falk field ) University Texas campus Memorial Day weekend , 1981 .   Judges included legendary race car engineer / owner / driver Indy 500 champion Jim Hall . sudden Texas rain storm sent scrambling cover endurance event day , weather failed dampen spirits students , judges , spectators Formula SAE born .  \n University Texas continued host event 1982 1984 popularity number participants grew .   subsequent years , UT moved Formula SAE competition parking areas included elevation changes driveway aprons forced use functioning suspensions .   event international 1982 entry Universidad La Salle team Mexico City .   significant rules changes 1982 : 1 ) displacement limit 600 cc ( 300 cc Wankels ) , 1 inch diameter restrictor rule retained , 2 ) requirement 4 - wheel independent suspension ( Mini - Indy suspension rules ) , 3 ) addition temporary \u201c B&S \u201d class vehicles originally designed Mini - Baja , retain 8 \u00a0 hp Briggs & Stratton engine , need comply 4 - wheel independent suspension rule .   Formula SAE continued international competition team Universidad La Salle returned .   engine restrictions displacement limit 600 cc 1 - inch maximum diameter intake , creativity flourished .   1983 , temporary B&S class eliminated , University Texas Austin entered composite Formula SAE vehicle Marquette University entered turbocharged engine .   rules allowed Formula SAE car compete years recognition effort required build test quality car .   allowed students experience - engineering improving design elements work .   rules 1984 specifically allowed turbochargers , superchargers , use nitrous oxide engine breathe 25.4 \u00a0 mm exit bore carburetor casting ( 1984 electronic fuel injection ) .   Engine intake restrictors later tightened cars faster year year knowledge passed teams .   , 65 - 100 inch wheelbase rule promulgated , rule requiring vehicles \u201c body resembles formula car \u201d .   Formula SAE field grown cars 1984 , University Texas Austin decided competition matured sufficiently safe pass hosts . University Texas Austin hosted competition 1984 . 1985 , competition hosted University Texas Arlington . , Dr. Robert Woods , guidance SAE student activities committee , changed concept competition students built pure racing car , mirrored SAE Mini - Baja competitions , design build vehicle limited series production . General Motors hosted competition 1991 , Ford Motor Co. 1992 , Chrysler Corp. 1993 . 1992 competition , formed consortium run Formula SAE . end 2008 competition , consortium ceased exist .   event funded SAE company sponsorships donations teams ' enrollment fees .

Design refers intentionally created thinking agent , refer nature \u2013 design . verb design expresses process developing design . cases , direct construction object explicit prior plan considered design ( arts crafts ) . design expected purpose certain context , usually having satisfy certain goals constraints , account aesthetic , functional , economic , environmental socio - political considerations . Typical examples designs include architectural engineering drawings , circuit diagrams , sewing patterns , tangible artefacts business process models . [ 1 ] [ 2 ] Designing [ edit ] People produce designs called designers . term ' designer ' generally refers works professionally design areas . professions , word ' designer ' generally qualified area practice ( example : fashion designer , product designer , web designer , interior designer ) , designate architects engineers ( : Types designing ) . designer sequence activities produce design called design process , design thinking possibly design methods . process creating design brief ( quick sketch ) lengthy complicated , involving considerable research , negotiation , reflection , modeling , interactive adjustment , - design . Designing widespread activity outside professions , formally recognized designers . influential book Sciences Artificial interdisciplinary scientist Herbert A. Simon proposed \" designs devises courses action aimed changing existing situations preferred ones \" . [ 3 ] according design researcher Nigel Cross \" \u2013 \u2013 design \" , \" Design ability , extent , embedded brains natural cognitive function \" . [ 4 ] History design [ edit ] Main article : Design history study design history complicated varying interpretations constitutes ' designing ' . design historians , John Heskett , start Industrial Revolution development mass production . [ 5 ] subscribe conceptions design include pre - industrial objects artefacts , beginning narratives design prehistorical times . [ 6 ] Originally situated art history , historical development discipline design history coalesced 1970s , interested academics worked recognize design separate legitimate target historical research . [ 7 ] Early influential design historians include German - British art historian Nikolaus Pevsner Swiss historian architecture critic Sigfried Giedion . Design education [ edit ] Institutions design education date nineteenth century . Norwegian National Academy Craft Art Industry founded 1818 , followed United Kingdom Government School Design ( 1837 ) , Konstfack Sweden ( 1844 ) , Rhode Island School Design United States ( 1877 ) . Polish \" Towarzystwo Polska Sztuka Stosowana \" ( 1901 ) Warsztaty Krakowskie ( 1913 ) . German art design school Bauhaus , founded 1919 , greatly influenced modern design education . [ 8 ] Design education covers teaching theory , knowledge values design products , services environments , focusses development particular general skills designing . primarily orientated prepare students professional design practice , based project work studio atelier teaching methods . broader forms higher education design studies design thinking . Design features general education , example Design Technology . development design general education 1970s created need identify fundamental aspects ' designerly ' ways knowing , thinking acting , resulting establishment design distinct discipline study . [ 9 ] Design process [ edit ] Substantial disagreement exists concerning designers fields , amateur professional , teams , produce designs . [ 10 ] Design researchers Dorst Dijkhuis acknowledged \" ways describing design processes \" , compare contrast dominant different views design process : rational problem solving process process reflection - - action . suggested paradigms \" represent fundamentally different ways looking world \u00a0 \u2013 positivism constructionism \" . [ 11 ] paradigms reflect differing views designing actually , variety names . problem - solving view called \" rational model \" , [ 12 ] \" technical rationality \" [ 13 ] \" reason - centric perspective \" . [ 14 ] alternative view called \" reflection - - action \" , [ 13 ] \" co - evolution \" , [ 15 ] \" action - centric perspective \" . [ 14 ] Rational model [ edit ] rational model independently developed Herbert A. Simon , [ 16 ] [ 17 ] American scientist , German engineering design theorists , Gerhard Pahl Wolfgang Beitz . [ 18 ] posits : Designers attempt optimize design candidate known constraints objectives . design process plan - driven . design process understood terms discrete sequence stages . rational model based rationalist philosophy [ 12 ] underlies waterfall model , [ 19 ] systems development life cycle , [ 20 ] engineering design literature . [ 21 ] According rationalist philosophy , design informed research knowledge predictable controlled manner . [ 22 ] Typical stages consistent rational model include following : [ 23 ] Pre - production design Design brief \u2013 initial statement intended outcome . Analysis \u2013 analysis design goals . Research \u2013 investigating similar designs field related topics . Specification \u2013 specifying requirements design product ( product design specification ) [ 24 ] service . Problem solving \u2013 conceptualizing documenting designs . Presentation \u2013 presenting designs . Design production . Development \u2013 continuation improvement design . Product testing \u2013 situ testing design . Post - production design feedback future designs . Implementation \u2013 introducing design environment . Evaluation conclusion \u2013 summary process results , including constructive criticism suggestions future improvements . Redesign \u00a0 \u2013 stages design process repeated ( corrections ) time , , production . stage associated best practices . [ 25 ] Criticism rational model [ edit ] rational model widely criticized primary grounds : Designers work way \u00a0 \u2013 extensive empirical evidence demonstrated designers act rational model suggests . [ 13 ] [ 14 ] [ 26 ] Unrealistic assumptions \u00a0 \u2013 goals unknown design project begins , requirements constraints continue change . [ 12 ] [ 27 ] Action - centric model [ edit ] action - centric perspective label given collection interrelated concepts , antithetical rational model . [ 14 ] posits : Designers use creativity emotion generate design candidates . design process improvised . universal sequence stages apparent \u00a0 \u2013 analysis , design implementation contemporary inextricably linked . [ 14 ] action - centric perspective based empiricist philosophy broadly consistent agile approach [ 28 ] methodical development . [ 29 ] Substantial empirical evidence supports veracity perspective describing actions real designers . [ 26 ] Like rational model , action - centric model sees design informed research knowledge . [ 30 ] views design activity consistent action - centric perspective . involve basic activities : reflection - - action paradigm , designers alternate \" framing \" , \" making moves \" , \" evaluating moves \" . \" Framing \" refers conceptualizing problem , i.e. , defining goals objectives . \" \" tentative design decision . evaluation process lead moves design . [ 13 ] sensemaking \u2013 coevolution \u2013 implementation framework , designers alternate titular activities . Sensemaking includes framing evaluating moves . Implementation process constructing design object . Coevolution \" process design agent simultaneously refines mental picture design object based mental picture context , vice versa \" . [ 14 ] concept design cycle understood circular time structure , [ 31 ] start thinking idea , expressing use visual verbal means communication ( design tools ) , sharing perceiving expressed idea , finally starting new cycle critical rethinking perceived idea . Anderson points concept emphasizes importance means expression , time means perception design ideas . [ 32 ] Philosophies [ edit ] Philosophy design study definitions , assumptions , foundations , implications design . informal ' philosophies ' guiding design personal values preferred approaches . Approaches design [ edit ] values approaches include : Critical design uses designed artifacts embodied critique commentary existing values , morals , practices culture . Critical design aspects future physically present provoke reaction . [ 33 ] [ 34 ] [ 35 ] Ecological design design approach prioritizes consideration environmental impacts product service , lifecycle . [ 36 ] [ 37 ] Ecodesign research focuses primarily barriers implementation , ecodesign tools methods , intersection ecodesign research disciplines . [ 38 ] [ 39 ] Participatory design ( originally co - operative design , co - design ) practice collective creativity design , attempting actively involve stakeholders ( e.g. employees , partners , customers , citizens , end - users ) design process help ensure result meets needs usable . [ 40 ] Recent research suggests designers create innovative concepts ideas working co - design environment creating ideas . [ 41 ] [ 42 ] Scientific design refers industrialised design based scientific knowledge . [ 43 ] Science study effects need potential existing product general design products based scientific knowledge . instance , scientific design face masks COVID-19 mitigation based investigations filtration performance , mitigation performance , [ 44 ] [ 45 ] thermal comfort , biodegradability flow resistance . [ 46 ] [ 47 ] Service design term designing organizing experience product service associated product use . purpose service design methodologies establish effective practices designing services , according needs users competencies capabilities service providers . [ 48 ] [ 49 ] [ 50 ] [ 51 ] Sociotechnical system design , philosophy tools participative designing work arrangements supporting processes \u2013 organizational purpose , quality , safety , economics , customer requirements core work processes , quality peoples experience work , needs society . Transgenerational design , practice making products environments compatible physical sensory impairments associated human aging limit major activities daily living . User - centered design , focuses needs , wants , limitations end - user designed artifact . aspect user - centered design ergonomics .
